# Apache Flink Documentation


## First Steps

- **Concepts**: Start with the basic concepts of Flinkâ€™s Dataflow Programming Model and Distributed Runtime Environment. This will help you understand other parts of the documentation, including the setup and programming guides. We recommend you read these sections first.


- **Tutorials**:
   - [Implement and run a DataStream application](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/getting-started/tutorials/datastream_api.html)
   - [Setup a local Flink cluster](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/getting-started/tutorials/local_setup.html)


- **Programming Guides**: You can read our guides about [basic API concepts](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/dev/api_concepts.html) 
and the [DataStream API](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/dev/datastream_api.html) 
or the [DataSet API](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/dev/batch/index.html) 
to learn how to write your first Flink programs.


## Deployment
Before putting your Flink job into production, read the [Production Readiness Checklist](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.9/ops/production_ready.html). 


## External Resources
- **Flink Forward**: Talks from past conferences are available at the [Flink Forward](http://flink-forward.org/) website and on YouTube. 
[Robust Stream Processing with Apache Flink is a good place to start](http://2016.flink-forward.org/kb_sessions/robust-stream-processing-with-apache-flink/).
- **Training**: [The training](https://training.ververica.com/) materials from Ververica include slides, exercises, and sample solutions.
- **Blogs**: The [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/blog/) and [Ververica](https://www.ververica.com/blog) blogs publish frequent, in-depth technical articles about Flink.
